## All right. So you must to ask yourself, why Node and React to solve this problem?

Well, we are going to start with Node.

**NODE:** Node is a technology widely used in nowadays, because he is oriented to events and input process no-blocking, and for these things he is very fast with very much data, light and efficient with communication in real time. But the real reason to use node is because i want to learn how to use this tech üòå.

## **And... why React?**

Despite the same reason above (because i want to learn Node and React), React its a framework widely used on website with fluid flux and they implements a feature called Single Page Application (SPA), and it's a good one to have in our website when the client add a new food, for example, on your car market.

# What is Online Check EMS ü§®?

Right, this project its exactly what his name is, LOL. EMS means just some letters of my name, no worry. Basically this project have the goal to abstract ALL dialog when you request an order on a commerce, for example. The WebSite, only made for that restaurant, i.e the restaurant have his own WebSite, with his own design and his own features, will connect to the API to get all important data to make it works. Before that, he informs his data, like name, address, the remaining money value if there is. How we are going to do it? Just using the WhatsApp API, generating a link to open the chat with all orders already typed.

Like that:
