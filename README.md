## All right. So you must to ask yourself, why Node and React to solve this problem?

Well, we gonna start with Node.

**NODE:** Node is a technology widely used in nowadays, because he is oriented to events and input process no-blocking, and for these things he are very fast with very much data, light and efficient with communication in real time. But the real reason to use node is because i want to learn how to use this tech üòå.

## **And... why React?**

Despite the same reason above (because i want to learn Node and React), React its a framework widely used on website with fluid flux and they implements a feature called Single Page Application (SPA), and its possible this is used for us when the client add a new food, or something, on your car market.

# What is Online Check EMS ü§®?

Right, this project its exactly what his name is, LOL. EMS is mean just some letters of my name, no worry. Basically, this project have the objective to abstract ALL dialog when you make a order on a commerce, for example. The WebSite, only made for that restaurant, i.e the restaurant have their own WebSite, with their design and their features, will connect with the API with all tables of database containing the foods, their prices and their description, like a ingredients used, and will list the products based on what he would like. Before that, he informs his data, like name, address, what remaining money value. How we gonna to do this? Just using the WhatsApp API, generating a link to open the chat with all orders already typed.

Like that: 



Its very practical, fast and efficient ü§Ø!

So, after builded, i would like to sell for someone, because i really want money üòû.
